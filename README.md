# air-observation-system

... under construction ...

An Arduino-based air quality monitoring system for gas detection. Since my apartment uses gas for water heating and cooking, this project tracks gas concentration levels for both statistical analysis and safety purposes.

Project Components:
- Arduino Firmware (Data acquisition and sensor control)
- Circuit Schematic (Coming soon)
- Python Web Server (Receives sensor data and exposes it via an HTTP Server-Sent Events endpoint)
- Interactive Dashboard (Real-time data visualization)
